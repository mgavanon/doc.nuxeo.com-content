## Released Changes

{{! multiexcerpt name='studio-updates-2021-03'}}

### Update of Studio Designer catalog
The Studio Designer catalog, in the code view, has been updated to include relevant LTS 2021 elements. These elements will be fully usable in front end templates, including relevant attributes.

### Before document modification" Event Handler filter by 'All of' and 'At least one of' 
In the Events Handler section, for the event "Before document modification" is will be possible to set the condition for triggering the event as either, "All of", when all the properties for a relevant document have been modified, or "At least one of", when any of the properties have been changed. It will remain possible to choose individual fields, as currently.

This will enhance the effectiveness of this Event Handler for complex modification scenarios.

### Removed 'Save' Popup when not necessary
In Studio Modeler, a pop-up proposes to save your work when browsing certain sections, even when no change has been made to that section. It has been removed in these instances.

### Saving of table settings in Studio Designer
We have fixed a behaviour whereby the settings applied to a table view of search results did not save correctly.

### Quick Switcher navigation
We have introduced a new quick switcher for navigating between studio projects and Nuxeo Online Services accounts, just type " " and see it pops up, from Studio or your NOS dashboard.

### Managing user permissions in Nuxeo Connect
We've made it easier to assign users to a service. In the 'Account Management' section tab of your Connect Interface, you will be able to more clearly assign users to services.

## Marketplace downloads
We've removed the download count for Marketplace Packages as the implementation needs to be reviewed.
